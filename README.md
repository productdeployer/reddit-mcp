2. **Connect to the MCP server**

   Copy the below json with the appropriate {{PATH}} values:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "reddit": {
         "command": "{{PATH_TO_UV}}", // Run `which uv` and place the output here
         "args": [
           "--directory",
           "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}", // cd into the repo, run `pwd` and enter the output here
           "run",
           "server.py"
         ],
         "env": {
           "REDDIT_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id",
           "REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret",
           "REDDIT_USERNAME": "your_username", // Optional for authenticated operations

   ```

   You can obtain Reddit API credentials by creating an app at [Reddit's app preferences page](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps).

   For **Claude**, save this as `claude_desktop_config.json` in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

   For **Cursor**, save this as `mcp.json` in your Cursor configuration directory at:

   ```
   ~/.cursor/mcp.json
   ```
